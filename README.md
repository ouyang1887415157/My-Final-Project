# My-Final-Project
This is the folder of my final project in Unity Version.

This is the final project of my University of London Computer Science Degree. (ZIXI OUYANG, STUDENT ID: 210300411)
This is a game called "The richest in Tang Dynasty" game that aims to entertain players with monopoly-like content and teach them knowledge about Chinese culture and history.
All the land tiles are named in the names of lands in Tang Dynasty in China, and there are over 50 Chinese knowledge questions waiting for the players in the Imperial Examination Hall.

## This is the Unity Version of my final project
You can open it with Unity Hub with any Unity Version that is compatible with Unity 6000.0.26f1.
Make sure you open the "SampleScene" file in the Assets/Scene folder in the Unity Editor to open the game correctly!
I changed the maxRounds to 36 rounds to speed up the process. You can change it to 48 rounds just like I did in the WebBuild Version!
